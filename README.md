# Crop Yield Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting crop yields based on various agricultural factors. The model utilizes historical data, including climatic conditions and agricultural practices, to forecast yields efficiently. This tool can assist farmers and agricultural planners in making informed decisions to optimize production.

## Features

- Predictive modeling for various crops.
- Utilizes multiple input features such as rainfall, temperature, soil quality, and more.
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables (e.g., region, crop type).
- Evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)


## Data

The dataset includes historical agricultural data, which consists of:

- **Regions**: Categorical variable indicating the geographical area.
- **Crop Types**: Categorical variable indicating the type of crop.
- **Features**: Numerical variables such as rainfall, temperature, soil quality, and fertilizer usage.
- **Target Variable**: Crop yield (in tons per hectare).

### Dataset Source
